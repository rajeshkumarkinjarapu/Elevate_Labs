1) I have imported the libraries like pandas, numpy, datetime 
2) I have imported the dataset
3) I have checked the dataset attributes like size of the dataset, coloumns and datatype of each column.
4) I have checked for null values,missing values and drop them which are irrelevant.
5) I have Standardized the columns like education and martial_status .
6) I have Convert date formats to a consistent type yyyy-mm-dd (pandas automatically converts).
7) I have Rename column headers to be clean and uniform by making it  lowercase and no spaces.
8) Finally, I have fixed the datatype for date column (obj to datetime).
